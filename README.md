This project is orginized as follow:

Classes Folder: This folder contains the main classes of the project, each responsible for specific functionalities.

    Repetition Class: Contains functions to remove repetition from the databases. This class provides methods to identify and eliminate duplicate or objects in the databases.

    Combination Class: Responsible for combining nodes databases into a single database.

    Shapefile Class: Manages and analyzes shapefile databases. This class likely provides functionalities to perform various operations on shapefile databases, such as reading, writing, querying, and analyzing spatial data.

    MultiToSingleLineString Class: Handles the conversion of geometry types from line to multi-line string. This class likely provides methods to transform geometries from one type to another, specifically converting line geometries to multi-line string geometries.

    GraphConstruction Class: Contains functions for constructing the graph. This class likely provides methods to build a graph representation from the spatial data, possibly using graph theory algorithms or spatial analysis techniques.

    GraphTools Class: Provides tools for visualizing the graph. This class likely offers functionalities to visualize the constructed graph, such as plotting nodes and edges, analyzing graph properties, and generating graphical representations.
